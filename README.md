### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Automate Docker image builds and pushes with GitHub Actions. Configuration is located in `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml`.

- **Build and push Docker image**: Automatically triggered on pushes to the `main` branch.

## üèóÔ∏è Kubernetes Deployment with MySQL

Deploy the Library Management System to Kubernetes with MySQL.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` installed and configured
- Docker Hub account with application image

### Kubernetes Manifests

The Kubernetes manifests are located in the `k8s` directory and include the following files:
- `mysql-secret.yaml`: Defines the Secrets for database credentials.
- `mysql-deployment.yaml`: Defines the Deployment for the MySQL database.
- `mysql-service.yaml`: Defines the Service to expose the MySQL database.
- `mysql-pvc.yaml`: Defines the PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data storage.
- `deployment.yaml`: Defines the Deployment for the application.
- `service.yaml`: Defines the Service to expose the application.
- `ingress.yaml`: (Optional) Defines the Ingress to route external traffic to the application.

### Apply Kubernetes Manifests

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/thilina01/library-management-system.git
    cd library-management-system
    ```

2. **Apply the manifests** to your Kubernetes cluster:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-secret.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-pvc.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/log-pv.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
    # Apply ingress only if you have set up an Ingress controller
    kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
    ```

### Accessing the Application

- **LoadBalancer Service**: Once the Service is created, it will provision a LoadBalancer. You can get the external IP using:
    ```sh
    kubectl get svc library-management-system
    ```
- **Ingress (optional)**: If you have set up an Ingress controller, you can access the application using the host defined in the `ingress.yaml` file. Ensure you have configured the DNS or `/etc/hosts` file to resolve the hostname.

### Additional Commands

- **Scale the Deployment**:
    ```sh
    kubectl scale deployment/library-management-system --replicas=5
    ```
- **Check the status of the pods**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -l app=library-management-system
    ```
- **Describe the Deployment**:
    ```sh
    kubectl describe deployment/library-management-system
    ```

### Cleanup

To delete the resources created, run:
```sh
kubectl delete -f k8s/mysql-secret.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/mysql-pvc.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/mysql-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/log-pv.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/service.yaml
# Delete ingress only if you applied it
kubectl delete -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

## üìú Logging

This project uses SLF4J with Logback for logging. The log configuration can be found in `src/main/resources/logback.xml`.

### Logback Configuration

The Logback configuration specifies the logging pattern, log file location, and log rotation policy. You can customize the configuration to suit your needs.

### Accessing Logs

Logs are written to both the console and a log file located at `logs/library-management-system.log`. The log file is rotated daily, and log files older than 30 days are automatically deleted.

### Logging Levels

The logging levels used in the project are:
- `INFO`: General application information.
- `DEBUG`: Detailed information used for debugging purposes.
- `ERROR`: Error messages indicating that something went wrong.

You can adjust the logging levels in the Logback configuration file to control the verbosity of the logs.

### Viewing Logs

To view the logs, you can either:
- Check the console output when running the application.
- Open the log file located at `logs/library-management-system.log`.

## üöÄ Testing

### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Library Management System. The tests can be run using Maven, and the results will be generated in a report format.

**Running Tests:**

To run the unit tests, execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Test Status Badges

You can monitor the status of your tests using badges that show the build status and test coverage. These badges will be updated automatically with each commit to the repository.

### Postman Collection
